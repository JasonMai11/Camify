### Notes
Challenges that encountered while building the app

-  The cropping feature took time as I had to work with the pod TOImageCrop, in addition once I crop an image then I had to show the result of the cropped image.
-  Text Analyzation. It took a time to understand how Apple's Text Analyzation worked, in addition I had to make sure that it was analyzing text from the cropped image itself.
